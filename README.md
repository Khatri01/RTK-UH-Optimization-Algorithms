# RTK-UH-Optimization-Algorithms
**"[An Ensemble Optimization of the RTK Unit Hydrograph]"**


## Description

This project provides the Python implementation of five metaheuristic algorithms used to calibrate the RTK unit hydrograph for a Rainfall derived inflow and infiltration assessment'].

The algorithms implemented are:

* Differential Evolution (DE)
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
